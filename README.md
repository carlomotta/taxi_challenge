# taxi_challenge

This project contains Python scripts than I created for a personal exercise on

 ·        Data acquisition & wrangling
 ·        Data visualisation
 ·        Predictive modelling
 
The dataset is available at the following URL and captures green taxi activity in NYC in 2015:

CONTENT:
The two main scripts are:

1) exploratory_analysis.py
I used this script to perform a basic data analysis and visualization

2) predictive_model.py
Applied the Gradient Boosting Classifier to the dataset                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Here, I integrate the original dataset with a dataset containing daily precipitations in NY. It can be found here: www.noaa.gov
